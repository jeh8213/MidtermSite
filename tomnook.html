            <div>In New Horizons, Nook has become a travel agent and it is through his company you purchase a get-away package to a deserted island - starting the events of the game. Tom Nook is the founder and owner of Nook Inc. Alongside this, he runs the Resident Services building. In this role he acts as the leader and developer of the island, and it is through his that you are allowed to upgrade the island and various buildings that can be built.</div>

            <div>Timmy and Tommy are shown to be sort of employees of his. At the start of the game, they are usually seen in the Resident Services Tent alongside Tom Nook, with Tommy roaming freely outside for most of the day. However, after completing construction of Nook's Cranny, they will always be found inside the store from 8am to 10pm.</div>
