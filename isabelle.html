            <div>Isabelle is friendly, polite, hardworking, and eager to help the player in any tasks she can assist with. She is keen to make the town a better place to live in by encouraging the player to do tasks and Public Works Projects throughout the town.</div>
            <div>-</div>
            <div>For her, the town she works in is like a family, she knows the ins and outs of it, and has enough influence to make a villager stop undesirable behavior - such as making them change their clothes or stop them from saying an unwanted catchphrase. Otherwise, she seems to prefer to not want to confront them.</div>
